  <b>Comment:</b>

  I'm not fully confident with setting a variable with let, var, const at times. Are there tips and tricks for this?
  I understand that in generally === and !== is prefered over == and != but when is it better to use == and != ?

  <b>Example:</b>

  let adventurous = true;
    if (adventurous) {
      console.log("Adventures are great!");
    } 
    else {
      console.log("How about we stay home?");
  }

  <b>Question:</b> 

  Is it better to use (adventerous) or (adventerous === true) if adventerous is already declared?
